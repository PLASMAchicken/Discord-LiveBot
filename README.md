# Don't use Livebot with User accounts, as it is bannable. Bots should still be ok!

### NOTE: Some of the assets in this project belong to Discord Inc, and anyone else it belongs to.

# Discord-LiveBot
Discord-LiveBot allows you to take control of your Discord bot using a client-like interface.

At the moment, LiveBot is still in alpha stage. To run it, open a terminal window in the main directory, then type `npm test`.

## What is this?
LiveBot is a program built with electron and discord.js, that will allow you to have discord controlling a bot. You are able to view messages in channels, send messages, interact with people, and see what is going on in the servers your bot is in. LiveBot will also work with a user account as well, so you are not just limited to bots.

LiveBot had been built to copy discord, and while it is not exact, it is pretty close. More additions will come soon, so just be patient, but feel free to recommend any addition, just create an issue!

### Token switcher
This box is how you log into a profile. To log into a token by default, put it into this box then press the save button. Otherwise if you are just logging into a token just for a look, input the token into the box then press `enter`.<br>

### Akira!
Akira is the livebot version of Discord's Clyde. Except Akira works like an actual Bot! Just use the prefix `/`. Only you can see what Akira says, so don't worry about interfering with any conversations. <br>

### Profile card.
The profile card is able to tell you the username, the avatar image, the discriminator, and something discord does not have. The profile card will tell you if the account you are signed into is a bot or a user. This can be handy if you are not quite sure. <br>

### Guild card.
The guild card gives a little more information than the basic discord 'name of the guild'. The guild card shows you the name of the guild, the guild icon, and how many users are in the guild. <br>
